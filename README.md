## _Brief Problem Statement_

The growth of the electric vehicle (EV) industry is hindered by the lack of convenient and accessible charging solutions. EV users face challenges in finding charging stations, managing financial transactions during the charging process, and monitoring the progress of the charging. The current solutions are often time-consuming, complicated, and stressful, which negatively affects the user experience and hinders the growth of the EV industry. 

This project aims to address these challenges and provide an innovative and effective solution to the problem of convenient and accessible EV charging. By developing user-friendly mobile applications and a web-based platform to control and monitor the charging bots, the project will make the charging process simple, efficient, and stress-free for EV users. The ultimate goal is to revolutionize the EV industry by providing a cutting-edge solution that will make charging EVs easier, more convenient and accessible for everyone. 

## _Aim_

The project is aimed at providing a convenient and accessible charging solution for electric vehicles (EVs) through the use of automatic charging bots. The objective is to simplify the charging process for EV users and boost the growth of the EV industry. The focus of this specific project is the development of user-friendly mobile applications and a web-based platform to control and monitor the charging bots. 

The mobile application for users will provide a simple and efficient solution for summoning the charging bots to their location and carrying out financial transactions. The app will allow users to track the charging process and receive updates on the progress. This user-friendly interface will help to make the charging process a convenient and stress-free experience for EV users. 

The web-based platform for administrators will provide real-time statistics and status updates on the bots. This will help administrators to monitor and manage the charging bots effectively, ensuring that they are functioning optimally and providing efficient charging services to EV users. The platform will also offer high-level control and moderation capabilities, allowing administrators to make adjustments and modifications to the bots as required. 

The ultimate aim of this project is to provide a seamless and efficient user experience through the use of cutting-edge software dashboards and platforms. The project will offer a comprehensive solution that addresses the challenges faced by EV users and provides a convenient, accessible and stress-free charging experience. The goal is to revolutionize the EV industry by providing an innovative and effective solution that will make charging EVs easier, more convenient and accessible for everyone.
